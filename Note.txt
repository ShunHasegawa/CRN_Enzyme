standard concentrations	0-100 uM at the beginning
			0-200 uM from 6/4/2016 
30/3/2016	plate1	column 12 is standard1
			column 1 is not used
31/3/2016	plate 1&2	100 ul of substrate was added instead of 50 ul, so 50 ul of H2O was added to standard wells to make volume consistent, resulting in 300 ul of the total volume
